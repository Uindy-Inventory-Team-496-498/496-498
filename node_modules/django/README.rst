Django
======

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design.

A package named `django` was previously published on NPM. That package **was
not** Django. However, NPM does not allow packages to be removed from their
index. This is an empty package replacing the historical package.
